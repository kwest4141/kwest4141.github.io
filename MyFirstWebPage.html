<h1>
Deep South's Oldest Rivalry
</h1>
<body style="background-color:red;">
<h2>Origin of Rivalry</h2>
<p>The oldest rivalry in SEC dates back to February 20, 1892. This was when the Auburn Tigers came to Atlanta to play the Georgia Bulldogs for their first meeting. The game was held at Piedmont Park to be the “even playing field” for both teams. This game was initiated by two main men, Charles Herty and George Petrie. Herty was the head coach of UGA at the time and their first ever head coach. Petrie was a trainer for the Auburn Tigers at the time. There were a couple years that did not hold a game for various reasons, one of those reasons including the two world wars. The Auburn Tigers ended up winning the first game 10-0. Little did these two teams know, this matchup would become one of the greatest in all of football. These two teams played each other almost every year since the beginning.</p>
<h2>Notable Games</h2> 
<p>Throughout the rivalry, the two teams have played a total of 123 games. The current record is 59-56-8 with UGA as the leader. This means that UGA has 59 wins, Auburn has 56 wins, and they have tied 8 times. With this many game played, we will look at some of the more notable games in the series. Of course, the most notable is the first game in 1892. Auburn took off with a win of 10-0. In 1899, the game was ended because of lighting issues and resulted in a tie. The interesting part was that Auburn was leading when the game was ended, so we will never truly know who would have won that game. In 1942, Georgia won the national championship. During the regular season, their only loss came from Auburn. In 1994, Auburn was on a 2o game winning streak until they tied with Georgia 23-23. In 2007, Georgia debut their black jerseys for the first time against Auburn. In 2017, Auburn and Georgia met 2 times in one season for the first time ever. Auburn won the first game in regular season 40-17. Georgia got their revenge in the SEC championship against Auburn 28-7.</p>
<h2>Other Major UGA Rivalries</h2>
<p>UGA has two other rivalries that will be filled with nothing but old fashion hate. One is UGA vs Florida, also known as <B>“World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party.”</B> This rivalry is interesting because neither team agrees on when the rivalry started. Georgia says it started in 1904, but Florida says it started in 1915. This is because the Florida team UGA played in 1904 is not modern-day Florida. Whatever the case, these two teams have started disagreeing since day one. Georgia leads the series 52-43-2. The game is held in Jacksonville Florida every year and fans from both teams invade the swamp for some good old-fashioned hate. Another rivalry is in-state Georgia vs Georgia Tech. This is also known as <B>“Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate.”</B> To students it is known as “Dawgs vs Nerds.” This rivalry started in 1983 with Tech winning 28-6. The series currently is lead by Georgia, 66-41-5. We are about to play Tech in a week and we will see who takes another win to increase the series.</p>
